# 🎓 Student Grades Tracker

A beginner-friendly Python CLI app developed by **Lakshmi Adhikari** to manage student grade records using dictionaries, loops, and exception handling.  
Built as part of my learning journey toward a **GenAI Developer** role at Google or Amazon.

- 🗑️ Remove student records
- 📋 View all students and their grades
- 📊 Show summary: total students, highest & lowest scores

## 💡 How It Works

This is a **menu-driven CLI (Command Line Interface)** app. You can:

1. Add student names and marks
2. View or remove specific student records
3. See a summary report showing:
   - Total students
   - Highest scorer
   - Lowest scorer
4. Clear all records
5. Exit anytime

It reinforces **dictionary operations**, **conditional logic**, **loops**, and **user input handling** — key Python skills used in GenAI app logic and data preprocessing.
